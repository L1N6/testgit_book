# Limitations

1. **Doesn't the software integrate a dashboard UI?**

<mark style="color:orange;">This is the first version of the software, and we will work on improving it in the future.</mark>

2. Does this software support users who speak other languages?

<mark style="color:orange;">While you can use other APIs to write your own, we recommend using JavaScript, specifically the Sails JS framework. It includes integrated blueprints, which help the software operate smoothly. Additionally, defining data types in JavaScript is more efficient and less labor-intensive, making it the optimal choice.</mark>
